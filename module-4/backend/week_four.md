* What's the purpose of a project management tool?
  Project management tools help us organize our tasks, especially when we work in teams.
  
* What are the stages of a card when using Pivotal Tracker?
  Start, Finish, Deliver, Accept/Reject
  
* What are the four types of cards available in Pivotal Tracker?
  Chore, Feature, Bug, Release
  
* What's your favorite project management tool?
  So far, I like Pivotal the best. Waffle is too dependent on Github issues and doesn't sync well, and Trello is too loose.
  
* Why do we create staging environments?
  Staging has all of the benefits of production, but the safety of not messing up production. We can test more thoroughly with staging.
  
* What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
  I think a good README should be concise, clear, and separated into appropriate categories (Getting Started, FAQs, etc).
  
* What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
  I'm going to test my ability to tab through the page and make certain content is available for screenreaders.
  
* What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
  SQL injection, fields in the strong params, not telling users which field is incorrect when they fail to login.
  
* Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
  Continuous integration is more agile, and it promotes modularity in code that allows for smoother transitions. It also creates a smooth deploy process.
  
* What are some continuous integration tools?
  Travis, Jenkins, Strider
#### Review  

* What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
  Atomic commits, never pushing with failing tests, creating feature branches
  
* What are the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming?
  Encapsulation, Abstraction, Modularity, DRY
  
* What's a module in Ruby and what's the difference between a class and a module?
  A module is comprised of code that can be applied to many different objects, whereas a class encapsulates a single responsibility for a particular object.
