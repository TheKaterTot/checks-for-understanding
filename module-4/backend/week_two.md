1. What is Webpack and why is it useful?
** Webpack bundles the JS modules, and also brings in the ability to require files on the client side. **
2. When do you want to use event delegation?

3. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?
** One big difference is the ability to wrap things in classes. **
4. What's the deal with semi-colons in JavaScript?
** Semicolons gets added when the code is compiled, and in most cases, I can write my JS without them and be fine. **
5. How are you using the MVC design pattern in your Quantified Self project?
** We're still organizing our code in models, views, and controllers to keep track of behavior and responsibility. **
6. How do you execute raw SQL in node?
** If I'm using knex, I use knex.raw, otherwise, I would have to make a direct connection to the database. **
7. What is CORS?
** CORS pops up when you make requests across domains, and you have to set the headers to accept requests from different domains or it will reject requests. **

12. What are some advantages/disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
